# Model Folder

Place your 3D model file here as `ilany.glb`

## Instructions:

1. Export your Polycam scan as a `.glb` or `.gltf` file
2. Rename it to `ilany.glb`
3. Drop it in this folder
4. The simulation will automatically load it on startup!

## Supported Formats:
- `.glb` (recommended - single file)
- `.gltf` (with textures)

## Tips:
- High-poly models (more vertices) show more detailed relativistic effects
- The model will be automatically centered and scaled to fit
- If no model is found, a procedural face will be used as fallback
